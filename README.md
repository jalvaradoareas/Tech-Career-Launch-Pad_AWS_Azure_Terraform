## How Much Will It Cost? 💲

The path to getting a job is, and there is no other way to say this.... 

**FREE**

That's right. If you have a reasonably good computer and an internet connection, all resources listed here are free unless otherwise indicated. 

Actually, that is not true. Your time has value. And to really make this move, it is going to cost you your time.

If you commit about 10 hours a week for 1-2 years, you can easily make over $100K/yr working remotely. Anywhere you have internet and your computer, you can do your job.

There are a number of resources that might be better organized, slightly higher quality, more in line with your learning style and maybe a more efficient use of your time, but these paid resources are optional. The web is filled with incredible, high quality, freely available educational resources that will put you in a place to get a job in tech.

## About Your Time 🕥

Time is precious. It is a non renewable resource. Your time is finite. Protect it and spend it on things that improve your life and the life of those your care about.

You will have to give up some things. You will not be caught up on the latest Netflix series. You will not make it out to the bar with your friends every weekend. You will miss the season finale of "The Masked Singer". But your life will be much improved for it.

## What Do I Need To Do To Make This A Reality? :eyes:

If you commit about 10 hours a week for 1-2 years, you can easily make over $100K/yr working remotely. Anywhere you have internet and your computer, you can do your job.
