# Basic IT Training ðŸ”¥

If you have little or no technology experience, start here. These courses from Google will introduce you to many of the core concepts of technology that will allow you to build a solid foundation for your tech career. 

## Paid Basic IT Training

This course was put first because it is the most well put together course and makes the most efficient use of your time to get you up to speed. But, alas, it is not free.

***NOTE:** there is a $39/month Coursera fee, so the faster you complete, the less you will pay.*

### Is This Course Relevant?

Depends. The certification itself might not be in high demand, but the base knowledge that you learn is very useful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXQxfYIF3A0

## Free Basic IT Training

It is understandable if you don't want to or cannot pay that money for the Google courses. The below courses should get you close to an online "Tech Basics" education for FREE.

***NOTE:** The coursed on edX can be audited for FREE, access is temporary, and upgrading to getting a certificate of completion is OPTIONAL. Basically, we recommend that you AUDIT ONLY. You still get the knowledge for free that way.*
