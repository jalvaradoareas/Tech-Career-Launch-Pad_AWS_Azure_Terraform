## Free Basic IT Training

These are the best free resources I have found for getting you started on your technology path. 

***NOTE:** The coursed on edX can be audited for FREE, access is temporary, and upgrading to getting a certificate of completion is OPTIONAL. Basically, we recommend that you AUDIT ONLY. You still get the knowledge for free that way.*

## Paid Basic IT Training

This course were put on this list because it one of the more well put together courses and makes efficient use of your time to get you up to speed. But, alas, it is not free.

***NOTE:** there is a $39/month Coursera fee, so the faster you complete, the less you will pay.*

### Is This Course Relevant?

Depends. The certification itself might not be in high demand, but the base knowledge that you learn is very useful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXQxfYIF3A0
