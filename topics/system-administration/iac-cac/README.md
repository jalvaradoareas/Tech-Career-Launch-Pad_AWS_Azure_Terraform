# Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) and Configuration-as-Code (CaC)

IaC and CaC tend to go hand in hand and often are possible within the same tool.

In my (MJ) opinion and experience, Terraform and Ansible are really the front runners here. While they do have some overlap, I like to use Terraform for deploying all the infrastructure (VMs, DBs, cloud firewalls, etc) and Ansible for managing the configuration of the deployed assets (Linux/Windows servers, firewalls, Kubernetes clusters, etc).

Also, there is a system I am working on a course for that joins the 2 tools. I call it "Terransible". (Don't hate. I am a tech guy not a marketer. ðŸ˜„) This uses Terraform to provision and track the state of all of the infrastructure and Ansible to provide the ongoing security and configuration management of the artifacts that are deployed. Be on the lookout for that.

## Infrastructure As Code (IaC)
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes.

With IaC, configuration files are created that contain your infrastructure specifications, which makes it easier to edit and distribute configurations. It also ensures that you provision the same environment every time. By codifying and documenting your configuration specifications, IaC aids configuration management and helps you to avoid undocumented, ad-hoc configuration changes.

## Configuration As Code (CaC)

Configuration as code is a technique of controlling your program that promotes the use of code to describe configuration settings.

When it comes to building and deploying software, there is often a separation of concerns between the applicationâ€™s source and the configuration of its server deployment.

Typically, the Ops team is responsible for developing the tools and configuration settings necessary to create and deploy your application across several server instances and environments.

Configuration as code promotes the idea of treating configuration settings the same way you would approach application code. This entails using version control to manage your setup settings. [Source](https://secpigeon.com/ultimate-guide-what-is-configuration-as-code-everything-to-know/)

## Terraform Training Resources

HashiCorp Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you define both cloud and on-prem resources in human-readable configuration files that you can version, reuse, and share. You can then use a consistent workflow to provision and manage all of your infrastructure throughout its lifecycle. Terraform can manage low-level components like compute, storage, and networking resources, as well as high-level components like DNS entries and SaaS features.

## Ansible Training Resources

AnsibleÂ® is an open sourceIT automation tool that automates provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, orchestration, and many other manual IT processes. Unlike more simplistic management tools, Ansible users (like system administrators, developers and architects) can use Ansible automation to install software, automate daily tasks, provision infrastructure, improve security and compliance, patch systems, and share automation across the entire organization.[Source](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/ansible/what-is-ansible)
