# DevOps Learning

## What is DevOps

A compound of development (Dev) and operations (Ops), DevOps is the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers.

What does DevOps mean for teams? DevOps enables formerly siloed roles—development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security—to coordinate and collaborate to produce better, more reliable products. By adopting a DevOps culture along with DevOps practices and tools, teams gain the ability to better respond to customer needs, increase confidence in the applications they build, and achieve business goals faster.

## Wait, what?

Yes, I realize that description might muddy the waters even more on what someone who is a DevOps or DevSecOps engineer actually does. To help explain this a bit better, take a look at this blog post. 

Hint: There are actually about 12 different high level skills makeups for a "DevOps" or "DevSecOps" engineer.

## So What DevOps Skills do I need?

I will divide this into bare minimum and then a more robust list. Remember, as previously stated, this is not a strict definition. 

Some mix of these skills (among others) will get you into a good DevOps role. 

Also, these lists are my (MJ) opinion and as I talk to more people and the industry evolves, I may update this list.

### Bare Minimum Skillset

- Linux Administration
- Basic Networking and DNS
- Familiarity with and at least 1 certifcation for 1 Cloud provider.
- Containers - Docker, Kubernetes and more
- Git/SCM

### Full DevOps Skillset(?)

- Linux Administration
- Cloud
- Networking and DNS
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Configuration as Code (CaC) - Terraform, Ansible, Bash, etc
- Containers - Docker, Kubernetes and more
- Python
- Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
- Git/SCM
- Monitoring and Alerting
- Log Management
- Firewalls, WAFs, Cloud Account Policy
- Familiar with Agile/Scrum
