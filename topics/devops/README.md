## What is DevOps

A compound of development (Dev) and operations (Ops), DevOps is the union of people, process, and technology to continually provide value to customers.

What does DevOps mean for teams? DevOps enables formerly siloed roles—development, IT operations, quality engineering, and security—to coordinate and collaborate to produce better, more reliable products. By adopting a DevOps culture along with DevOps practices and tools, teams gain the ability to better respond to customer needs, increase confidence in the applications they build, and achieve business goals faster.

Yes, I realize that description might muddy the waters even more on what someone who is a DevOps or DevSecOps engineer actually does. To help explain this a bit better, take a look at this blog post. 

Hint: There are actually about 12 different high level skills makeups for a "DevOps" or "DevSecOps" engineer.
